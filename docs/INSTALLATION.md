# Installation

## System Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `exiftool` (system package, optional but recommended)

### Installing exiftool

exiftool provides the best EXIF extraction for all formats. Without it, the app falls back to `exifread` (Python library, handles all RAW formats) then PIL (JPEG/TIFF/DNG only).

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| Ubuntu/Debian | `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl` |
| macOS | `brew install exiftool` |
| Windows | Download from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/) |

## Python Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install base dependencies (all at once for proper dependency resolution)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For 8gb/16gb/24gb profiles, also install:
pip install transformers>=4.57.0 accelerate>=0.25.0

# For 24gb profile, additionally:
pip install qwen-vl-utils>=0.0.2
```

## GPU Setup

### PyTorch with CUDA

Install from [pytorch.org/get-started/locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) based on your CUDA version.

### ONNX Runtime for Face Detection

Choose ONE based on your setup:

| Option | Command |
|--------|---------|
| CPU only | `pip install onnxruntime>=1.15.0` |
| CUDA 12.x | `pip install onnxruntime-gpu>=1.17.0` |
| CUDA 11.8 | `pip install onnxruntime-gpu>=1.15.0,<1.18` |

**Check your CUDA version:** Run `nvidia-smi` and look at the top-right corner for "CUDA Version: X.X".

If switching from CPU to GPU version:
```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime
pip install onnxruntime-gpu>=1.17.0
```

### RAPIDS cuML for GPU Face Clustering (Optional)

For large face databases (80K+ faces), GPU-accelerated clustering via cuML significantly speeds up face clustering. Requires conda environment:

```bash
# Create conda environment with CUDA support
conda create -n facet python=3.12
conda activate facet

# Install cuML (choose your CUDA version)
conda install -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia cuml cuda-version=12.0

# Alternative: pip install
pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com/ "cuml-cu12"

# Install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When cuML is available, face clustering automatically uses GPU (configurable via `face_clustering.use_gpu` in `scoring_config.json`).

## Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import torch, cv2, fastapi, insightface, open_clip, numpy, scipy, sklearn, PIL, imagehash, rawpy, tqdm, exifread; print('All imports successful')"
```

## Troubleshooting Dependency Conflicts

Facet has many ML dependencies (`torch`, `open-clip-torch`, `insightface`, etc.) that pull in their own transitive dependencies. pip resolves dependencies sequentially, which can lead to cascading errors where installing one package breaks another.

### Symptoms

- Installing packages one-by-one triggers errors asking you to install yet another package
- Version conflicts between `torch`, `numpy`, `huggingface-hub`, or `open-clip-torch`
- `pip install` succeeds but `import` fails at runtime

### Solutions

**1. Install everything at once** — gives pip the full dependency graph to solve:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Do **not** install packages individually (`pip install open-clip-torch && pip install insightface && ...`) — this prevents pip from resolving the full graph.

**2. Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead of pip** — `uv` resolves the complete dependency graph upfront before installing anything, avoiding cascading conflicts:

```bash
# Install uv
pip install uv

# Install all dependencies with full resolution
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# With CUDA index for PyTorch:
uv pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

**3. Start fresh** — if your environment is already in a broken state:

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### GPU Detection Issues

If your GPU is not detected (common with newer GPUs like RTX 5070 Ti), run the diagnostic tool:

```bash
python facet.py --doctor
```

This checks PyTorch CUDA support, driver compatibility, and suggests the correct pip install command. You can also simulate GPU scenarios for testing:

```bash
python facet.py --doctor --simulate-gpu "RTX 5070 Ti" --simulate-vram 16
```

## First Run

On first run, Facet automatically downloads:
- CLIP model (ViT-L-14): ~1.7GB
- InsightFace buffalo_l model: ~400MB
- SAMP-Net weights (all profiles): ~50MB

Models are cached in standard locations (`~/.cache/` or `~/.insightface/`).

## Angular Client (Optional)

```bash
# Only needed for development or custom builds
cd client
npm ci
npx ng build    # Production build → client/dist/
npx ng serve    # Dev server on http://localhost:4200 (proxies API to :8000)
```

### SAMP-Net Manual Download

The automatic download for SAMP-Net weights may fail (the GitHub release URL is no longer available). If you see:
```
Failed to download SAMP-Net weights: HTTP Error 404: Not Found
```

Download manually:
1. Download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sIcYr5cQGbxm--tCGaASmN0xtE_r-QUg/view)
2. Place the file at `pretrained_models/samp_net.pth`
